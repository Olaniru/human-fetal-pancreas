## Olaniru et al manuscript: Single cell transcriptomic and spatial landscapes of the developing human pancreas

This repository contains the scripts used to explore the single cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets of the developing human pancreas presented in **Olaniru et al: Single cell transcriptomic and spatial landscapes of the developing human pancreas** 

The scRNA-seq data were from 7 time points (12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 and 20 PCW) while the 10x Visium data were from 12, 15, 18 and 20PCW. 
We integrated our scRNA-seq with a recently published dataset on the developing human pancreas (Yu et al., 2021) to have 8-20PCW. 

### The following analyses will be included (the codes are being prepared for clearer readability):
1. Integration and analysis of multiple scRNAseq data
2. Monocle 3, time-series and in situ pseudotime trajectory inference
3. Analysis of spatial transcriptomics data 
4. Integration of scRNAseq and spatial transcriptomics
